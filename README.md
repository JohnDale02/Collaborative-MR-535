# Collaborative-MR-535



# Motivation:
Our motivation behind this project is rooted in the applicability of mixed reality scenarios to benefit productivity, entertainment, connectivity and beyond. Mixed reality has an untapped potential, and our team would love to contribute to helping push this technology forward. Our work will provide us with hands on experience for collaborative mixed reality scenarios, and in turn, the research community with valuable datasets. We are excited to work with this technology and help the research community.

# Design goals:
- Enable a collaborative MR environment with two Hololens
- Mimic typical collaborative scenarios for mixed reality in a local environment
- Design experiements over the collaborative mixed reality application to best collect a robust dataset


# Deliverables:
- Research and implement system setup for collaborative MR
- Identify the type of application for experiments
- Design experiments for two subjects wearing headset and interacting with a common scene
- Collect, manage and label the data
